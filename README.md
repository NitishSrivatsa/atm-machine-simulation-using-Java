# Simple ATM Machine Simulation Using Java
SYNOPSIS:
•	An Automated Teller Machine (ATM) allows customers to perform banking transactions anywhere and at anytime without the need of human teller. By using a debit or ATM card at an ATM, individuals can withdraw cash from their accounts, make a deposit or check balance or perform other operations.

1.	Balance enquiry 
2.	Mini statement
3.	Cash withdrawal 
4.	Cash deposit
5.	Change of pin
•	A set of account numbers and corresponding passwords will be included in a file.
 Functions for the above mentioned operations will be implemented within the Java code and all the concepts of our Java course will be used.
